# Students_Stress_Level_Predictor
## Overview

The Stress Level Predictor is a web application that predicts an individual's stress level based on their responses to a set of questions. It uses machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor, to make predictions. This project is built using Python and Streamlit for the frontend.

## General Info


Ml based project which uses decision tree regression to predict stress level . Applied 2 model : decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor and found the most suitable model for prediction.
Used stremlit for deployment.
When user will enter the responses for the question and hit the predict button, the predicted stress level would be shown to the user.



## Installation
Clone the repository:
cd stress-level-predictor
